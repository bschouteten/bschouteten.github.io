# This blog

The goal of this blog series is to get familiar with verilator and to write simple and re-useable testbenches in C++. Where a full simulation/ software model of the RoaLogic SoC will be the goal.

Within this first part we start by getting some more information about verilator and getting it up and running with our System Verilog code. For the initial tryout we start by using a simple UART16550 implementation which runs on the APB4 bus. This design will also be part of the SoC implementation and still needs testing, making it the ideal starting point of this journey.

# What is verilator

Verilator is cycle based simulator, so the circuit state is evaluated once per clock-cycle. Which makes it different to other simulators which are more event-based. Due that it is cycle based it ignores all the timing simulations and asynchronous logic. Meaning that it ignores everything between clock edges. This makes the simulator fast and very good to simulate synchronous digital logic circuits with one or multiple clocks. 

It parses Verilog or SystemVerilog code into C++ or systemC files, which can then be compiled by a C++ compiler. This can be done very minimum or with a wrapper file. It’s completely open-source and can produce waveforms for analyzing, however it’s not a full-featured replacement for a closed-source Verilog simulator.

## First steps

Within this first part we will explore the setup for Verilator with the UART and investigate how to setup the project so it’s possible to start expanding and developing the C++ code for testing and simulating the UART. This part does need some experience in makefiles to understand, since the goal here is not to fully explain the functionality of the makefiles.

## Install & try verilator

Let’s first install verilator, check the [install guide](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html) for more information, also directly install GTKWave for viewing waveforms. After installing let’s try an example program to make sure everything is functional, find the example [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/example_cc.html#example-c-execution). After following the instructions and executing the example, let's now proceed to start using it with the [UART16550 implementation](https://github.com/RoaLogic/apb4_uart16550). 

As indicated by the example it’s very tedious to run the example everytime by hand, so let’s start by explaining the makefile in the UART project to compile and run Verilator. For the UART project the makefiles are located under /sim/rtlsim/apb4/bin. The Makefile within this folder is a more general Makefile and can be used for multiple simulators, which will be ignored within this context. All the design files are added in the Makefile.Include, making it easy to have one file to adjust when files are added, also making the other makefiles portable to other projects.

Going in the folder /sims will show the Makefile.verilator, which is the most interesting file. This makefile will have automated behaviour for the same commands as mentioned in the Verilator example. The design files are added from the Makefile.Include, where the specific flags to run Verilator are set within this file. (It also checks for the Verilator root to grab the needed include files for C++ compilation)

``` make
#Set VERILATOR_ROOT if not already set
VERILATOR_ROOT ?= $(shell bash -c 'verilator -V | grep VERILATOR_ROOT | head -1 | sed -e " s/^.*=\s*//"')
VERILATOR_FLAGS ?= -Wall -Wno-PINCONNECTEMPTY
VERILATE_FLAGS ?= -CFLAGS -DVL_NO_LEGACY $(VERILATOR_FLAGS) -structs-packed --trace
```

Following is the make command to verilate the SystemVerilog code

```make
$(OBJDIR)/V%.mk: $(OBJDIR) $(VLOG)
	echo "--- Verilating $*"
	verilator $(VERILATOR_FLAGS) $(VERILATE_FLAGS)		\
	-Mdir $(@D) --cc $(VLOG) --top-module $*		\
	$(foreach d,$(DEFINES),+define+$d)			\
	$(foreach d,$(INCDIRS),+incdir+$d)			\
	$(foreach l,$(wildcard $(LIBDIRS)),-y $l)
#+libext$(foreach e,$(LIBEXT),+$e)

```

At the end of this step we can now easy verilate our design with the makefile. Making it easier for ourself and faster to rerun and adjust without always having to type in the commands.

## Our first C++ program
After verilating the design it’s now possible to build our testbench top C++ file. This file will then simulate the design. For now let’s start with the simple example and see that our design is doing something.

The include files  ```<verilated.h>``` and ```<verilated_vch_c.h>```  are needed for the common Verilator functions. Where the other include files are specific to the project, ```<Vapb_uart16550.h>``` is the primary design header which contains the converted System Verilog code, which is used to instantiate the design. 

It's possible to have multiple Verilated models within the same simulation context. In this case it wouldn’t be necessary to create one, however for future proofing let’s immediately add it. When no verilated model is created a default global model will be created. Our model is stored within a unique_ptr to store it in a safe way and have exclusive ownership. Followed by the verilated context the verilated model/ dut is created, which is the actual system Verilog design. 

```C++
    std::unique_ptr<VerilatedContext> contextp(new VerilatedContext);
    VerilatedContext* _context = contextp.get();  // Verilator Context
    Vapb_uart16550* _core = new Vapb_uart16550;   // Verilator Model to test
```

It’s also possible to pass arguments to the verilated design. This is passed by the function commandArgs(). See [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/exe_sim.html) to see all possible Verilator arguments, at this point no arguments are passed into the design.

```C++
    // Parse the given parameters into this application
    contextp->commandArgs(argc, argv);  
```

Following this a loop will be needed to run the simulation, in this case we will do 20 loops and stop the design. Where within every for loop it will change the clock pin of the design and check the design. Verilator gives out every top level pin of the design as a variable and this can be given any state. In our design the PCLK is the clock pin of the design, so every time this pin goes from 0 to 1 this will trip all logic connected to the ```@(posedge PCLK)``` within the design. The evaluation of the design is done by the Verilator eval() function. 
```C++
// loop 20 times
for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 20; i++)   
{ 
    _core->PCLK = 1;
    _core->eval(); 
    _core->PCLK = 0;
    _core->eval();
}
```

At the end the simulation final() function must be called, this method will execute any system Verilog final blocks. After that the system can be closed and everything deleted. 

```C++
// finalize the design
_core->final();
delete _core;
```

Putting this all together will give us the following C++ file. This is now our testbench top module and will simulate the complete design. However with this design we don't see anything functional then just our program starting and ending. 

``` C++
//For Verilator methods
#include <verilated.h>
#include <verilated_vcd_c.h>

//Include specific model header, generated by Verilator
#include "Vapb_uart16550.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{
    std::unique_ptr<VerilatedContext> contextp(new VerilatedContext);
    VerilatedContext* _context = contextp.get();  // Verilator Context
    Vapb_uart16550* _core = new Vapb_uart16550;   // Verilator Model to test

    // Parse the given parameters into this application
    contextp->commandArgs(argc, argv);  

    // loop 20 times
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 20; i++)   
    { 
        _core->PCLK = 1;
        _core->eval(); 
        _core->PCLK = 0;
        _core->eval();
    }

    // finalize the design
    _core->final();
    delete _core;

    return 0;
}

```

## Adding a trace into the design

Currently we have a simulation which can run, however at some point we would also like to see the waveform. So let’s update our existing code so that Verilator also produces a waveform which we can see.

```C++
//For Verilator methods
#include <verilated.h>
#include <verilated_vcd_c.h>

//Include specific model header, generated by Verilator
#include "Vapb_uart16550.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{
    std::unique_ptr<VerilatedContext> contextp(new VerilatedContext);
    VerilatedContext* _context = contextp.get();  // Verilator Context
    Vapb_uart16550* _core = new Vapb_uart16550;   // Verilator Model to test
    
    // Parse the given parameters into this application
    contextp->commandArgs(argc, argv);  

    Verilated::traceEverOn(true); // Set the trace on
    VerilatedVcdC* _trace = new VerilatedVcdC; // Create a new trace instance
    // Pass the trace instance to out verilator context
    // The 99 is the depth of the trace, in this case 99 meaning all signals
    _core->trace(_trace, 99);
    // Open the trace and pass the name/file location
    _trace->open("waveform.vcd"); 

    // loop 20 times
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 20; i++)   
    { 
        _core->PCLK ^= 1;
        _core->eval();
        _trace->dump(i); // Write all traced signals into the waveform
    }

    // finalize the design
    _core->final();
    _trace->close(); // Close the trace so it can be opened
    delete _core;

    return 0;
}
```

Within this it’s visible that three parts are added. First part is the creation and connection of the trace module, which happens before the simulator starts doing something. It tells Verilator that the trace is on, creates a trace object and passes it to our testbench. With this we also give the trace depth into the system, which means the first 99 layers from the top. So this will log all the levels of the design, depending on what is needed, this could also be lowered. Last part to set it up is to open the trace, as parameter we give the filename with. The file will then be created in the same folder as the Makefile.

Within the for loop, the dump() function is added. Calling this will write all traced signals into the waveform according to passed parameter. This parameter is a “moment in time”, which is relative to the start point of the waveform. After fully running the simulation the close() is called, which closes the file so it can be viewed.

Opening the file in the GTKwave and adding the PCLK signal into the layout will give the following view. As we can see here, the clock signal has been toggled 20 times, following our programmed for-loop.

This will be it for the first part of this blog. We now got everything up and running and in the next blog we will go into creating general files which can be used to setup multiple different test benches.
