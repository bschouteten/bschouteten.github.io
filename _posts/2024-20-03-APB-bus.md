# Signals with coroutines

In this blog we will look into the bus interface, this bus is used for communicating between various hardware modules in a System-on-Chip (SoC) design. In our current design the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol is used. This protocol is widely used as a standard for connecting low-speed peripherals to a CPU in a SoC. It is originally designed by ARM as part of the ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA). However let's not limit our design to APB only and write it in such way that if we change the bus interface in the hardware design we only have to adjust the bus interface in our Verilator testbench.

Find here a link to the protocol APB protocol: [APB protocol](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0024/latest/)

We'll start a bit with the software design on how to create and how to use it. Following this we start to expand the design and start adding in some APB sequences. During the addition of the sequence we will also look into how a sequence works and what the limitations are.

##  Software design

It's not necessary that every testbench needs a bus, so this means that we don't need to include a bus into our `cTestBench` class. Bus interfaces are quite design specific and therefore they belong into `cAPBUart16550TestBench` class. However it's possible that we have the same design with different bus architectures, but we still want to communicate in the same way. This means that a APB bus is a bus interface and we should build it in this way, where our design testbench class has a bus interface. Following this our bus interface is more a virtual interface where the derived classes will implement the bus specific logic. So our derived class must have knowledge about the signals in the design. As for the functions, let's in our design for now assume we only need to read and write. In a later stage we could still expand this and adjust with gained knowledge.

Do note that the image is a small representation of what we exactly will build, read onwards to see how the full design is expanded. 

# APB bus and the bus interface

Let's start by looking into the APB interface and see what kind of signals it has, further along get some more information about the address and data bus inside a bus protocol. An APB interface has single addres bus, it is used for read and write transfers. Where it has two independent data buses, PRDATA for read data and PWDATA for write data. The data buses can be 8, 16 or 32 bits wide, they must have the same width. There is always on side which is the requester, the requester will initiate transfers to the completer. Completer is the side which will handle the transfer.

APB operation is done by using a finite state machine (FSM). There are three states named, IDLE, SETUP and ACCESS, where every transfer takes at least two cycles (SETUP and ACCESS). The first transfer will wake three clock cycles, following transactions are completed in two clock cycles. IDLE state is the default state and nothing is happening at this moment. SETUP state is active when a transfer is required, in this phase the PSEL signal will be asserted, signaling the beginning of a transfer. The bus will only enter the SETUP phase when the transfer is needed, otherwise remain in the idle phase. All control signals are at this moment set and the bus will stay in this phase for one clock cycle, it will automatically move to the ACCESS state. The ACCESS state is mainly used to tell the a transaction is ongoing/completed. At the start of the ACCESS phase the PENABLE will assert high and all other control signals will remain stable. PENABLE and PREADY will assert, indicating completion of one transaction. If more transactions are needed the bus will move back to the SETUP phase again, otherwise it goes back to the IDLE state.

APB bus signals:

| Signal | Source | Width | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ------------- |
| PCLK  | Clock  |   1   | Clock of bus | 
| PRESETn| System bus reset | 1 | Reset signal of the bus, active low | 
| PADDR | Requester | ADDR_WIDTH | Address input of the bus |
| PSELx | Requester | 1 | Select signal for the specific bus module| 
| PENABLE | Requester | 1 | Indicate the second and subsequent cycle of an APB transfer |
| PWRITE | Requester | 1 | Direction of the transfer, HIGH = write, LOW = read |
| PWDATA | Requester | DATA_WIDTH | Data to write in the current transfer, can be 8, 16 or 32 bits wide |
| PREADY | Completer | 1 | Signal to extend an APB transfer by the completer |
| PRDATA | Completer | DATA_WIDTH | Read data bus, can be 8, 16 or 32 bits wide |
| PSLVERR | Completer | 1 | Signals a transfer error |

## APB in software

First thing to build is the bus interface, which is a re-useable between all kind of different buses. Initially we start with a simple interface and can always extend it later on, so we start with a read and write sequence. As we have seen in the APB bus it's possible that we have different bus widths, so we have to account for this. Which is done quite easily by using a template, as template parameters we will then pass the address width and the data width, by default the addres is 32bit wide and the address bus 8bit. Any given bus can only handle one single transaction at once, to track this we add the `_busy` flag. This flag must be set in the beginning of a transaction and be cleared on the end, where we use start and end functions for. The state of the bus can then be retrieved according to `busy` and `done` function to indicate the state. For completenes we also add the `_error` flag, with this we can signal to the bus user that the bus is in an error state. 

We now have the more general control added, let's now look at some specific functions which we will need. All the specific functions will be a coroutine since they have their own logic which has to wait on certain clock edges. Next to this, they will be pure virtual so that the derived class must implement them. For now we keep it simple and implement a single read, multiple read, single write and a multiple write.

``` C++
template <typename addrT = unsigned long, typename dataT = unsigned char> 
class cBusInterface : public common::cUniqueId
{
    protected:
        bool _busy;
        bool _error;

    public:

        /**

        cBusInterface() : _busy(false), _error(false) { }

        virtual ~cBusInterface() {}


        /** @brief Start a bus transaction

         */
        virtual void transactionStart() { _busy = true; }


        /** @brief End a bus transaction
         * @details This function ends a bus transaction
         * by setting the _busy flag to false. It must be called 
         * at the end of every transaction
         */
        virtual void transactionEnd() { _busy = false; }


        /**
         * @brief Check if a bus transaction is busy
         *
         * @return true when a transaction is in progress
         */
        virtual bool busy() { return _busy; }


        /**
         * @brief Check if a bus transaction is done
         *
         * @return true when the current transaction completed
         */
        virtual bool done() { return !_busy; }


        /**
         * @brief Bus transacted terminated with/due to error?
         *
         * @return true when the bus transaction terminated with/due to an error
         */
        virtual bool error() { return _error; }


        /**

        virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> read(addrT address, dataT& data) = 0;

         * @result               Array of read data
         */
        virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> burstRead(addrT address, dataT* buffer, unsigned burstCount) = 0;


        /**
         * @brief Perform a single write transaction on the bus

        virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> write(addrT address, dataT data) = 0;


        /**

         */
        virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> burstWrite(addrT address, dataT* buffer, unsigned burstCount) = 0;
};
```

We have now seen our abstract bus class, now we also have to create the APB bus itself. Our APB bus is also a template class, as spoken of before, this is to make sure we can use the different bus sizes. In our derived class we also need to have access to the signals of the bus. So as our private variables we added the corresponding signals as reference, only the clock will be passed as pointer. Signals will be passed through the constructor and can then be used within the class to generate signals. We will implement the specific read and write functions later on in this blog.

``` C++
template <typename PADDR_t, typename PDATA_t> 
class cBusAPB4 : public cBusInterface<PADDR_t, PDATA_t>
{
    private:
        cClock*   PCLK;         //!< Clock signal of the bus
        uint8_t&  PRESETn;      //!< Reset signal of the bus
        uint8_t&  PSEL;         //!< Select signal of this bus instance
        uint8_t&  PENABLE;      //!< Enable signal to indicate next cycle of the APB bus
        PADDR_t&  PADDR;        //!< Address to read/write, size is according to the template parameter
        uint8_t&  PWRITE;       //!< Direction of the transfer, '1' is write, '0' is read
        PDATA_t&  PWDATA;       //!< Data bus for writing
        PDATA_t&  PRDATA;       //!< Data bus for reading
        uint8_t&  PREADY;       //!< Signal to extend an APB transfer
        uint8_t&  PSLVERR;      //!< Signal for bus error

    public:
        /**
         * @brief Constructor of the APB bus
         */

        }
};

```

As last we have to instantiate the bus in our uart testbench, if this is done we are able to build our design with a bus interface. Our testbench has-a APB bus, so we create it as a private variable, `cBusAPB4<uint8_t, uint8_t>* apbMaster;`. In our system verilog design the address and data bus are both 8-bit, so in our instantation we can just use `uint8_t`. In the constructor of our testbench we then must connect the right signals of the system verilog design with the verilator bus.

``` C++
cAPBUart16550TestBench::cAPBUart16550TestBench(VerilatedContext* context, bool traceActive) : 
    cTestBench<Vapb_uart16550>(context, traceActive)
{
    //define new clock
    pclk = addClock(_core->PCLK, 10.0_ns);       // 100MHz clock

    //Hookup APB4 Bus Master
    apbMaster = new cBusAPB4 <uint8_t,uint8_t>
                          (pclk,
                           _core->PRESETn,
                           _core->PSEL,
                           _core->PENABLE,
                           _core->PADDR,
                           _core->PWRITE,
                           _core->PWDATA,
                           _core->PRDATA,
                           _core->PREADY,
                           _core->PSLVERR);
} 

```
# APB read and write in verilator

By default the bus is in the IDLE state at T0. When a write transaction is needed the signals PSEL, PWRITE, PADDR and PWDATA will be asserted high in T1 according to the clock edge, by this a transaction is started. By doing this the bus has now entered the setup phase as we have seen previously. Following the setup phase the bus now waits until PENABLE and PREADY are both asserted high, which indicates the completion of a write transaction in APB. If there are any further transactions needed PENABLE will become low and it enters the SETUP state again, at this moment PREADY is also set back to low to signal completion of the next transaction. It's also possible that we have wait states, in this case the PENABLE signal will remain high until PREADY is also asserted high. Only when both are asserted high it will move to the next transaction or end the transaction.See the following images, where a full write transaction is shown and a transaction with a wait state.

## APB write in C++

In our C++ code we have to control the bus and write data into our uart design. We have seen how to control the signals, so let's start to fill in our write function. Due that APB transactions work on clock cycles we make sure that those functions are coroutines. As we have seen in the previous blog, it's very easy to set the signals and then wait for a clock edge and proceed to the following part of the transaction. To support this let's create to simple macro's which we can use as high and low, in our case high is a signal that is asserted to 1 and low is a signal set to 0, `#define L (!1)` and `#define H (!0)`. 

To start the transaction we first have to proceed to the Setup phase, this is done by asserting PSEL, which means that PADDR, PWRITE and PWDATA must be valid. First set PENABLE to low to make sure our module is selected, following this PWRITE is asserted as we are writing. PADDR is set to the passed address and PWDATA takes the given data, or to make it more easy here we set the address and data to write to our module. Then as last PSEL is asserted and the bus will wait until the positive clock edge to transition into the Setup phase. 

When in the Setup phase there is not much to do, the work is then more in the consumer of the bus. We just have to assert PENABLE high and wait for another positive clock edge to advance into the access phase. Here we have to wait until the PREADY is low and PENABLE is high, however we must take account wait states. From a SW perspective this isn't to difficult, we can just use a `while` loop and wait for PREADY to go low. Since PENABLE is asserted only PREADY is important and if the data is directly ready we can just advance without waiting for another clock edge.

``` C++ 
virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> write(PADDR_t address, PDATA_t data)
{
    bool result = false;

    if(!this->busy())
    {
        DEBUG << "APB4 bus(" << this->id() << ") write " << hex << unsigned(data) << " to address " << hex << unsigned(address) << '\n';

        this->transactionStart();
        _error = false;

        for(uint8_t)

        // Here we are at the IDLE phase
        // Now we set the signals accordingly
        PENABLE  = L;
        PWRITE   = H;
        PWDATA   = data;
        PADDR    = address;
        PSEL     = H;

        // Wait for the positive edge of the clock to transition into the Setup phase
        waitPosEdge(PCLK);

        // Set PENABLE high, advance to the access phase happens automatically with the next clock cycle
        PENABLE  = H;

        waitPosEdge(PCLK);

        // Wait until PREADY is in the right state and then transition out of the transaction
        // PENABLE is already at the right state, since we set it at that point
        // Since this is a single transaction it ends here.
        while (PREADY == L) waitPosEdge(PCLK);

        PSEL     = L;
        PENABLE  = L;

        // Check the result of the operation and report it back
        _error = (PSLVERR == H);
        result = !_error;

        this->transactionEnd();
    }
    else
    {
        FATAL << "APB4 bus(" << this->id() << ") in busy state\n";
    }

    co_return result;
}
```

We now have a APB write function for a single data transaction, however what if we want to write more data. In APB it's not really possible to pass more data in a single transaction, but it's possible to have multiple transactions after each other. This is visible in the state diagram, when the bus is in the access phase and PREADY is asserted it will transition to either idle or setup depending on PENABLE. So if we want to write more data we just need to do multiple transactions after each other. So with some minor adjustments we can expand our write function.

To have multiple transactions we just need to loop the number of transactions needed. This should be passed by the caller, the same that the caller passes a pointer to the buffer of data to write. Within our loop we just need to advance the address. Since the user will pass the start address of the write.

``` C++ 
virtual sCoRoutineHandler<bool> write(PADDR_t address, PDATA_t* buffer, unsigned burstCount=1) 
{
    bool result = false;
    uint8_t addressOffset = sizeof(PDATA_t); // Determine the size of a single element so we can advance the address

    if(!this->busy())
    {
        this->transactionStart();
        _error = false;

        // Perform the number of transaction passed by the user
        for (size_t i = 0; i < burstCount; i++)
        {
            DEBUG << "APB4 bus(" << this->id() << ") write " << hex << unsigned(buffer[i]) 
                    << " to address " << hex << unsigned(address + (addressOffset * i)) << '\n';

            // Here we are at the IDLE phase
            // Now we set the signals accordingly
            PENABLE  = L;
            PWRITE   = H;
            PWDATA   = buffer[i]; // Loop through the passed data buffer
            PADDR    = (address + (addressOffset * i)); // Set the address, add the offset onto the address
            PSEL     = H;

            // Wait for the positive edge of the clock to transition into the access phase
            waitPosEdge(PCLK);

            // Set PENABLE high, so that we transition into the access phase with the next clock cycle
            PENABLE  = H;

            waitPosEdge(PCLK);

            // Wait until PREADY is in the right state and then transition out of the transaction
            // PENABLE is already at the right state, since we set it at that point
            // Since this is a single transaction it ends here.
            while (PREADY == L) waitPosEdge(PCLK);

            PENABLE  = L;
        }

        // PSEL is only set when we transition back to the idle state, which is when there are no more transactions
        PSEL     = L;
        
        _error = (PSLVERR == H);
        result = !_error; // Set the result false in case we had a bus error

        this->transactionEnd();
    }
    else
    {
        FATAL << "APB4 bus(" << this->id() << ") in busy state\n";
    }

    co_return result;
}
```

## APB read in C++

APB read is almost exactly the same as APB write, only PWRITE should be set 'low' and data is read from PRDATA instead of written by PWDATA. So as starting point we directly take the coroutine of the write function. PWRITE is set to 'low' and instead of setting the buffer to PWDATA, we now move this down below when the transaction has finished. At this point we take the data from PRDATA and place it in the buffer. The function will then look the following.

# Creating a test with APB write and read

We now can write and read with the APB bus, the last part now is to add it together and see that everything works as expected. In a UART16550 there is a scratchpad register which is designed to be used for any purpose. It doesn't affect the UART operation in any way, which is ideal in our situation. We can write a value into this register and then read it back. With this we can test the APB write and read, but also the scratchpad register itself. The full UART16550 explanation will come at a later stage.

Since we already added the APB interface in our test design, we just need to write the specific testcase. Let's call it the `scratchpadTest`, in this test we will write a random value into our scratchpad and following this read it back. This will then be done for x amount of times, which can be specified by the user. At first we generate a reset signal, so that our test always starts in a clean state. Following this we wait for a positive clock edge before we continue our test. Our test is very simple, the numbers that we run are passed in so we use a `for` loop to run so many times. In the for loop we get the random value to write, next we write it into our scratchpad register and then directly read it back. The last step is then comparing the value to see if it was correct.

``` C++

sCoRoutineHandler<bool> cAPBUart16550TestBench::scratchpadTest (size_t runs)
{
    uint8_t writeValue, readValue;
    bool result = true;
    INFO << "Start scratchpad test\n";
    co_await generateReset();

    waitPosEdge(pclk);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < runs; i++)
    {
        INFO << "Run: " << i << " ";

        writeValue = std::rand();   // Get a random value

        // Write the random value into the scratchpad register
        // SCR is the scratchpad address
        co_await apbMaster->write(SCR, &writeValue);

        // Directly read the value back from the scratchpad register
        co_await apbMaster->read(SCR, &readValue);

        if(writeValue != readValue)
        {
            //values are not the same, test has failed
            result = false;
            APPEND << "Failed: Expected: " << std::hex << unsigned(writeValue) << 
                                    " got " << std::hex << unsigned(readValue) << "\n";
        }
        else
        {
            APPEND << "ok \n";
        }
    }
    
    INFO << "Scratchpad test ended\n";

    co_return result;
}

```

When we run this code the following output will be visible. Where we can see that our APB write and read sequence is fully functional, but for completeness let's also check our waveform and compare it with the waveforms seen for APB write and read.

*APB Write Read sequence*

In this blog we looked at how the APB bus works and we implemented it in our design. Next to this we wrote our first very simple test for the UART 16550 module, the scratchpad test. However this test is still very basic and can use somme better testing. This is exactly what our next blog will be about.
